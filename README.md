# Semiconductor-Fabrication-101

**Semiconductor-Fabrication-101** is an introductory winter course designed to give students a clear and practical understanding of **how chips are actually fabricated** inside world-class semiconductor foundries such as **TSMC, GlobalFoundries, Intel, Samsung, and Texas Instruments**, jointly taught by **Purdue University** and supported by **SemiX IIT Bombay**.

## What This Course Covers

- Overview of the global semiconductor manufacturing ecosystem  
- Step-by-step walkthrough of the **CMOS fabrication process**  
- Photolithography, oxidation, ion implantation, etching, deposition, CMP, and packaging  
- Cleanroom operations and contamination control  
- Fab workflow, process integration, and module sequencing  
- Scaling, yield improvement, and advanced node manufacturing  

## Learning Outcomes

By the end of this course, you will be able to:

- Understand how a chip is built layer-by-layer inside a semiconductor fab  
- Identify key fabrication steps and understand their purpose  
- Explain how modern fabs maintain precision, throughput, and yield  
- Relate fabrication steps to device physics and VLSI design  
- Appreciate the engineering complexity behind commercial chip manufacturing  



## Who Is This Course For?
 
- Beginners curious about semiconductors  
- VLSI/design learners who want to understand the *fab side*  
- Anyone interested in chips, nanotechnology, or advanced manufacturing  

No prior experience required — **just curiosity.**
